I received the M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Pelotas](https://ufpel.edu.br){:target="\_blank"} (UFPel) in 2017 and 2014, respectively. Besides that, I conclude my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from the [Federal Institute Sul-rio-grandense](https://ifsul.edu.br){:target="\_blank"} (IFSul) in 2018. I'm also a technician in Electronics from the Federal Institute Sul-rio-grandense since 2009.

Currently, I'm pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Pelotas acting as a doctoral student researcher at the [Group of Architecture and Integrated Circuits](https://wp.ufpel.edu.br/gaci/){:target="\_blank"} (GACI). My main interests include the logical and physical synthesis of VLSI circuits, algorithms for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and for digital circuit design automation.
