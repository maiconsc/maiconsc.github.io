Currently, I am pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Pelotas acting as a doctoral student researcher at the [Group of Architectures and Integrated Circuits](https://wp.ufpel.edu.br/gaci/){:target="\_blank"} (GACI). My main interests include the physical synthesis of VLSI circuits and the algorithmic development for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools in emerging and traditional technologies.
